- 30,000 posts in 7 days. Here's what happened.

Hey [Name],

Quick one.

We're Cliptokk - we deploy TikTok content at scale for labels and artists.

Recent campaign:
→ 30,000 posts in 7 days
→ Result: #2 Billboard Hot 100

We work with teams who understand that TikTok is a volume game, not a "post once a day" game.

### TEMPLATE 2: Labels & Artist Managers (Soft)

**Subject:** Quick question about [Artist]'s TikTok strategy

**Body:**
```
Hey [Name],

Saw [Artist]'s recent release doing well. Nice work.

Quick question - are you handling TikTok distribution in-house or working with a network?

We help labels deploy at scale (1,000-30,000 posts per campaign) through our distribution network.

Not pitching hard - just curious how you're approaching it.

If you ever want to compare notes, happy to chat.

### TEMPLATE 3: Independent Artists (with budget)

**Subject:** Your TikTok distribution (honest take)

**Body:**
```
Hey [Name],

I'll be direct.

If you're posting once a day on TikTok and wondering why it's not breaking through...

It's not the content. It's the volume.

Labels deploy thousands of posts through distribution networks like ours.
That's why their stuff goes viral and independent artists struggle.

We level that playing field.

Recent results:
- 800M+ views generated
- 200K+ posts distributed
- Artists hitting charts and playlists

If you're serious about breaking through, let's talk strategy.

15 min: [Calendly]

No BS, just real talk about how this works.

Hey [Name],

Saw [Brand] is pushing on TikTok. Smart move.

Question: are you relying mainly on paid ads or organic distribution?

We help brands get massive organic reach through volume distribution.

Recent campaign:
- 8,000+ posts deployed
- 50M impressions
- 12x ROAS

No influencers. No ad spend. Just scale.

If [Brand] is looking to dominate TikTok organically, worth a 15 min call?

## RESPONSE TEMPLATES

### When they ask "How does it work?"

```
Good question!

Simple version:

1. You send us content (videos, clips, hooks)
2. We deploy across our network (500+ TikTok accounts)
3. We post 1,000-30,000 times depending on the campaign
4. TikTok's algo sees massive signals → pushes your content

The algo rewards what it sees everywhere. We give it volume.

Want me to walk you through a recent campaign on a call?
```

### When they ask "What's the cost?"

```
Depends on scale:

- Growth: 300 posts/month → €1K
- Campaign: 5,000 posts/month → €10K
- Scale: 10,000+ posts/month → €30K

Most clients start with a Campaign tier to see results, then scale up.

Worth jumping on a call to figure out what makes sense for your goals?
```

### When they ask "Is this legit / not bots?"

```
100% legit.

- Real accounts, real engagement
- Organic reach, no paid ads
- We're distributing, not botting

We've generated 800M+ real views. Labels like [example] use this approach.

Happy to show you analytics from past campaigns if that helps.
```

### When they say "Not right now"

```
No worries at all!

If anything changes or you have a release coming up, feel free to reach out.

In the meantime, I share a lot about TikTok distribution on [Twitter/LinkedIn] if you want to stay in the loop.

Good luck with everything!
```

### When they say "Interested, let's talk"

```
Perfect!

Here's my calendar: [Calendly link]
